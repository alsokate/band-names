## Band Names

I started this list in 2008-ish.  Every time someone has said, "that's definitely a band name", I've added it to this list.  I should probably feel bad about this likely being my magnum opus, but nah.

If, for whatever reason, you're inspired by this list and decide to adopt something from it as your own band name, I would be absolutely delighted, just please let me know so I can follow your journey to stardom.

#### You can add to the list by submitting a PR!  Some rules, because I can:

* Please only append new names to the end of the list -- there is something of a chronology in here that's sentimental to me.  
* Include the context of where your name came from in `name-context.txt`!  I would *love* a full story if you're up to it, but a short sentence or a particular quote taken hilariously out of context is also great.

Since the people who are likely to see this already had names on this list prior to me giving this thing its own git repo, I just wanted to let you know that I really appreciate you and the joy you've brought me with this little project over the years.  Thank you for being you.
